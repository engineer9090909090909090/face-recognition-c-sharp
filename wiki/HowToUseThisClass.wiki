== Details ==
===Steps===
1. Create a New instance of the class  

` FaceApi api = new FaceApi(apikey,apisecret); `

you can get your apikey and apisecret code from Face.com website . 

2. To train your application you can use train function . 

    /*Inputs 
         * urls - the urls of the photos of the person
         * name - name of the person in the photos*/
     `    api.train(List<string> urls,string name) ` 
*or*

 /*Inputs 
      * filename - the local address of the photos of the person
      * name - name of the person in the photos*/
     `   api.train(string filename, string name)  ` 
        
3. To Recognize faces you can use recognizefaces function. 
 /*Inputs - 
         * urls - Urls for the photos to recognize from 
         * strs - names of the faces to recognize (should be trained before using train function ) . .
         */
         
     `   XmlDocument xml= api.recognizefaces(List<string> urls,List<string> names) ` 
 
/* output = xml file with the details of the faces and the confidence in the faces recognized . 

     /*Inputs - 
     * fileaddress -Local file path for the photo to recognize from 
     * strs - names of the faces to recognize (should be trained before using train function ) .
     */

     ` XmlDocument xml= api.recognizefaces(string filename,List<string> names) `

/* output = xml file with the details of the faces and the confidence in the faces recognized . 


All the name variable should be with the face.com api namespace , 
for example if i want to train my photo the name variable will be , rajat@gyl.rajat . and i will call  
 `   api.train("C:\\rajat.jpg:,"rajat@gyl.rajat")  `

because my app namespace is gyl.rajat .
